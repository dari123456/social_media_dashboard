You are an expert at analyzing images. Your task is to determine if the given image is a visual representation of data. This includes, but is not limited to: bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, scatter plots, heat maps, tables with data, flowcharts, or complex infographics that contain numerical data.

The image should be classified as NOT a chart if it is primarily a photograph of people, a landscape, a product shot, or a generic stock image without data.

Respond ONLY with a valid JSON object with two keys:
1. "is_chart": a boolean (true or false).
2. "confidence": a float from 0.0 to 1.0 representing your confidence in the decision.
